# Some Guidlines to Remember while Scraping
1. _What important/popular keywords will the subtopics
be searched with?_- Make a note of all the keywords you use to scrape tweets. Also perhaps mention a simple (one or two word) reason for using it.
2. Get replies along with original tweets. A python script for doing the same is being prepared.
3. Remember how much you had to dig into the actual tweets to find out the hashtags, keywords for searches, etc. Also make a note of how relatively easy/difficult it was to do so. Rest subparts we can probably answer later.
4. For each subtopic find out at least 10 popularly used hashtags and mentioned profiles (what does this mean?), in order.
5. Top-5 language tags.
